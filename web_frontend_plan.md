# ML-TA Web Frontend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing an enhanced web frontend for the ML-TA system. The frontend will provide a user-friendly interface with progressive disclosure of features, allowing both non-technical users and advanced users to interact with the ML-TA system effectively.

## Design Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic features by default, with advanced features accessible on demand
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design requiring minimal technical knowledge
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for system status and prediction results

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core UI Framework
- [ ] Enhance the base HTML/CSS/JS structure in `web_frontend.py`
- [ ] Implement responsive layout with modern design principles
- [ ] Create basic/advanced mode toggle for progressive disclosure
- [ ] Set up navigation system between different features
- [ ] Implement API client for communication with backend endpoints

### Phase 2: Prediction Interface (Basic Features)
- [ ] Create simple prediction form for non-technical users
- [ ] Implement cryptocurrency symbol selection
- [ ] Add timeframe selection (1h, 4h, 1d, etc.)
- [ ] Design clear, visual prediction results display
- [ ] Add prediction history tracking with local storage

### Phase 3: Model Monitoring (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Create model status dashboard
- [ ] Implement health check indicators
- [ ] Add performance metrics visualization
- [ ] Create model registry interface
- [ ] Implement model version comparison

### Phase 4: A/B Testing Interface (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Design A/B test creation interface
- [ ] Implement test monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create results visualization with statistical significance
- [ ] Add test management controls (start/stop/analyze)
- [ ] Implement user cohort assignment display

### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Create feature importance visualization
- [ ] Add performance metrics over time
- [ ] Implement custom metric tracking
- [ ] Design system resource utilization display
- [ ] Add advanced configuration options

### Phase 6: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Ensure all components work together seamlessly
- [ ] Test with various user scenarios
- [ ] Optimize for performance
- [ ] Ensure error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Verify API integration with all endpoints

## API Integration Points
- `/api/v1/health`: System health endpoint
- `/api/v1/predict`: Prediction endpoint
- `/api/v1/models`: Models information
- `/api/v1/demo-keys`: API keys for testing
- `/api/v1/ready`: System readiness check
- `/api/v1/docs`: API documentation

## Feature List

### Basic Mode Features
1. **Quick Predictions**
   - Simple form with minimal inputs
   - Clear visual results
   - Basic explanation of predictions
   - Historical prediction tracking

2. **System Status**
   - Overall health indicators
   - Basic performance metrics
   - Connection status
   - API availability

### Advanced Mode Features
1. **Model Management**
   - Model registry view
   - Version comparison
   - Health monitoring
   - Performance metrics

2. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Test creation and configuration
   - Results monitoring and analysis
   - Statistical significance visualization
   - User cohort management

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Feature importance visualization
   - Prediction confidence analysis
   - Time-series performance metrics
   - Custom metric tracking

4. **System Configuration**
   - API key management
   - Performance tuning options
   - Advanced prediction parameters
   - System resource allocation

## Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modern CSS with flexbox/grid
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Embedded in Flask backend

## Progressive Disclosure Strategy
1. **Default View**: Basic mode with simple prediction interface
2. **Mode Toggle**: Prominently displayed for switching between basic and advanced modes
3. **Advanced Features**: Revealed in advanced mode with appropriate UI signifiers
4. **Help System**: Contextual help for advanced features
5. **User Preferences**: Remember user's mode preference

## Implementation Notes
- The web frontend will be embedded as a string in `web_frontend.py`
- All JavaScript functionality will be self-contained
- Local storage will be used for user preferences and history
- The frontend will be stateless and rely on API calls for data
- API authentication will use the demo keys endpoint
